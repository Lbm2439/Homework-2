                  After a lot of years wandering around this planet confused, I
                  think I found something I really enjoy. Coding! It all started
                  on a bored summer day in San Diego, California. I found myself
                  drinking wine and building puzzles. I became so addicted to
                  puzzles, it almost ruined my social life.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Kidding, point is, I was THAT bored! I had a degree in Graphic
                  Deisgn and Photography that I used, but only when jobs became
                  availabe. That field of work was becoming so saturated and jobs
                  were highly competitive and people no longer wanted to pay for
                  services and believe it or not, San Diego is outrageously
                  expensive, and it looked like, I was going to need a few million
                  to get by.
                  <br />
                  <br />
  
                  Kidding, again. I decided to create a side hustle to make extra
                  cash and make work not feel so much like work. I opened a
                  business, clothing to be exact. I created every piece of
                  advertising graphic, logo, website, etc, all alone in my living
                  room. With the help of a large amount of coffee and Adobe
                  Creative Suite, my empire grew! I think somewhere around this
                  point I saw myself doing more web design. Upon moving back home
                  to Richmond, a friend asked if I knew how to code, because they
                  were hiring and figured I would be good at it. A month later, I
                  was inrolled at The University Of Richmond and loved everysecond
                  of my new found "puzzles".
